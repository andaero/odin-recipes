        <strong>Ingredients: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 pound freshly ground sirloin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 potato rolls</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>Four 1/4-inch-thick tomato slices</li>
            <li>4 burger-sized pieces green-leaf lettuce</li>
        </ul>

        <strong >Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li> Divide into four equal-sized, loosely meat pucks about 2 1/2 inches thick. </li>
            <li> Heat a griddle, large cast-iron skillet, or large heavy stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and place the buns, cut-side down, in the pan. Cook until cut sides are golden-brown, about 2 minutes</li>
            <li> add a patty to griddle and immediately press one of the spatulas flat on top of the patty. Use the handle of the other to hammer the spatula down, smashing the patty until 1/2 inch thick</li>
            <li> Flip each patty once the first side is deeply browned and crisp with craggly edges, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes for medium. Season the cooked side generously with salt and pepper</li>
            <li> Add a slice of cheese and continue to cook until melted, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes more</li>
            <li>Top burgers with tomatoes and lettuce</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
